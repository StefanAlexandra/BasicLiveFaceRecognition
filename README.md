# BasicLiveFaceRecognition

This code captures video from the computer's camera and continuously checks if the face in the captured frame matches a reference image. 
It does so by verifying the faces using the DeepFace library and displays the result on the video frame. The program can be terminated by pressing the 'q' key.
